  OzDASL is a library of data sets and associated stories. It is intended as 
  a resource for teachers of statistics in Australia and New Zealand and 
  elsewhere. Emphasis is given to data sets with an Australasian context, 
  although interesting data sets from anywhere in the world are included.

description:
  This study was conducted at a major north eastern American medical centre 
  regarding blood cholesterol levels and heart-attack incidents. A total of 
  28 heart-attack patients had their cholesterol levels measured two days, 
  4 days, and 14 days after the heart attack. In addition, cholesterol levels 
  were recorded for a control group of 30 people who had not had a heart attack.
